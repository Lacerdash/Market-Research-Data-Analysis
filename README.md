# Market Research Data Analysis for Targeted Personal Financial Planning Services

## Project Overview

In today's competitive financial landscape, understanding customer behavior is key to creating tailored products and services. This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that analyzes market research data for an entrepreneur seeking to identify customer segments and behaviors. The analysis is part of a personal freelancing project.

## Key Features

1. **Demographic Analysis**: In-depth exploration of the target audience by age, social class, and gender.
2. **Behavioral Insights**: A deep dive into customer interests and behaviors, correlated with key demographic characteristics.
3. **Visualizations**: Engaging and informative visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
4. **Statistical Validation**: Chi-square tests to validate observations, ensuring data-driven decision-making.
